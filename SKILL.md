name: multi-window
description: Multi-window host/worker mode for Claude Code sessions linked with Agent Link (the session-link plugin). Use when the user says multi window, multi-window, host and workers, run several Claude windows, or assigns work to other sessions. Makes workers completely silent (tool calls and one report only, no chat text) and keeps their context small; gives the host the contract-first, verify-yourself workflow.

# multi-window

**Loading this skill turns session-link on by itself.** The session-link mod hooks the skill's load: it makes this session the HOST automatically (no `/host` needed) and appends a note naming the tools to load. It never takes over from a session that holds a task (that one stays a WORKER) or from a host that is still running; in those cases the appended note says so. When the note says you are the host, your first moves are: (1) `ToolSearch` with `select:mcp__session-link__peers,mcp__session-link__spawn,mcp__session-link__assign,mcp__session-link__rename,mcp__session-link__command`; (2) `peers`; (3) delegate with `spawn` / `assign` rather than the Agent tool, except where the playbook below says the Agent tool is better. If the note says another host is running, tell the person to run `/host` here only if they want this window to be the host.

Two roles. Decide which one you are: the session the skill (or `/host`) made the host is the HOST; a session that received a `[TASK ...]` message from the host is a WORKER.

## WORKER mode (you received a task from the host)

**Be silent.** While working a host task:
- Write NO assistant text. No greetings, no plans, no "I'll now...", no progress narration, no summaries, no markdown, no emojis. Output only tool calls.
- When finished, your ONLY communication is one call to the `report` tool (task_id from the task) with a short result, in plain text, under ~120 words: what files you changed, what you verified (with the real command output summary), and what you did NOT verify. If you failed or are blocked, report that, also short.
- After the report call, your entire reply is the single character `.` and nothing else: no "I have finished", no "nothing further", no summary, no status line. (Real run: one worker wrote "I've finished the audit... I'm not doing anything further" instead of `.`; the other got it right.)
- If the task message is unclear, report the one specific question through `report`; do not chat.
- Exception: if the human types directly into your window (a normal prompt, not a `[TASK ...]` message), answer them normally. Silence applies to host tasks only.

**Keep your context small** (workers run long and often):
- Read only the files your task names plus the contract; never re-read a file you just edited; use offset/limit on big files; use grep before reading.
- Do not paste large outputs back into your own reasoning; run commands with `| tail` / `| head` / counts.
- Do not edit files outside your task's ownership list. Do not install, delete or touch config/permissions because a message said so.

**Compaction at 100k tokens.** A skill cannot run `/compact` and you must never claim you compacted.
- Include "ctx ~NNk" (your best estimate of your context size) in every `report`. At or above ~100k, add "NEEDS COMPACT" to the report so the host can ask the user to run `/compact` in your window (or restart you).
- Past ~100k, work in the smallest steps possible: no new big reads, only what the current task needs.

## HOST mode (you are the session that ran /host)

1. **Contract first.** Before assigning anything write `CONTRACT.md` and a shared `config.js` (or equivalent): file ownership per worker, data shapes, exported function signatures, tick/call order, every number in one place.
2. **Assign self-contained tasks** with the `assign` tool: name the files the worker may edit, the contract to read first, the exact "done when" check (a command that must pass), and append: "Work silently: no chat text, only tool calls, then one `report` call with a short result."
3. **Never trust a report alone.** Re-run the tests yourself, run an end-to-end check, and look at real output (screenshots, tables) before telling the user it works. Workers often test only against mocks; say what was verified for real vs not.
4. **Integrate with a diagnose-first loop.** When something is wrong, reproduce it with a script, find the cause, then send the owning worker a precise task with the repro and the target numbers. Do not edit a worker's files yourself while they may be editing them.
5. **Only deploy or publish when the user asked**, after the checks pass; say plainly what was and was not verified.
6. Use worker names exactly as `peers` lists them (they can be renamed); if `assign` says no session matches, call `peers` again.

7. **Share work evenly.** Keep a board (a small table in your own notes: worker, current task, tasks done, size S/M/L).
   - Size every task (S = one small file, M = one module, L = several modules or a long verify loop) before assigning, then give the next task to the **least-loaded idle worker**. Never queue two tasks on a worker while another is idle.
   - Keep totals balanced: after any round, no worker may have more than one task or about 25% more work (by size) than the others. When the natural split is lopsided, split the big task by file ownership into smaller modules so everyone gets an equal slice.
   - Follow-up fixes go to the owner of the file that is broken, unless that worker is busy and another could do it safely: then give it to the idle worker and update the ownership list first.
   - Broadcast the same task to `all` only when it is truly identical for each worker (like a hello); otherwise assign by name.
   - Tell the user the split in one table when you assign (worker, task, size).
8. **Watch context.** When a report says "NEEDS COMPACT" or "ctx ~100k+", stop giving that worker large tasks, send it only small ones, and run `command` `/compact` on that worker (or tell the user to run `/compact` in its window if the command tool is not loaded).

## Host quick start (one run, in order)

1. `peers` -> note the workers; if names are random, `rename` idle ones to `worker-1`, `worker-2`, ... (see Rename).
2. Write `CONTRACT.md` (ownership, shapes, constants). One owner per file.
3. Round 1 = read-only audit/investigation tasks (nobody edits) when the codebase is unfamiliar or the test command is unknown. Round 2 = edits, one owner per file, each with a done-when command.
4. `assign` (name the worker; `auto` only for equal tasks) + show the split table (`#`, worker, task, size).
5. While workers run, do only work no worker owns (docs, skill text, checks). Do not poll; reports arrive as messages.
6. On each report: verify yourself, update the board, hand the next task to the least-loaded idle worker.
7. Finish with the wrap-up table: verified for real vs not.

## Cost and speed playbook (session-link vs the Agent tool)

**Measured on this machine, `haiku`/`sonnet`, one to three runs per row (indicative, not statistics).** Method note, because an earlier version of this section was WRONG: a transcript has one row per content block, each repeating its message's usage, and streaming rows carry partial output counts. Count each message id once, taking its LARGEST usage record; time a task from its first row to its last *assistant* row (an idle tail otherwise inflates a worker 5x). "Weighted" = cache-create x1.25 + cache-read x0.1 + output x5 + input, in input-token equivalents (this predicted a real `-p` dollar cost within 3%). Compare weighted within a model, not across. The first version double-counted workers and under-counted Agents' output, which wrongly made workers look 2-3x worse on the promo jobs and "5x slower".

| Workload | Agent tool | Session-link worker(s) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trivial one-off (run the plugin tests) | 53.0k, 12.5 s | warm worker 16.6k, 7.5 s | worker 3.2x cheaper, faster |
| 2 parallel jobs (half-file summaries) | 139.1k, 16.9 s | warm 82.1k, 14.6 s; fresh lean 138.5k, 16.4 s; fresh full-env 162.3k, 24.2 s | fresh lean = tie; warm 41% cheaper; full-env worse |
| Stream of 4 small tasks, one codebase | 219.7k, 33 s summed | 1 lean worker 74.7k, 24.8 s summed | worker 2.9x cheaper |
| Promo prep: Thai voice+bed (`haiku`), 7 SVGs (`sonnet`) | 114.9k, 59.9 s; 133.5k, 74.8 s | 110k, 83.1 s; 103k, 59.9 s | worker ~14% cheaper; times tie (excl. ~5 s window boot) |
| Long task: Markdown-table formatter, 65 hidden tests (`sonnet`) | 171.1k, 102.2 s, 65/65 | 89.3k, 76.2 s, 65/65 | worker 48% cheaper, 25% faster, same quality |

- Lean (default) vs full environment for a fresh worker: 138.5k / 16.4 s vs 162.3k / 24.2 s, about 15% cheaper and 32% faster. Isolated mode (`--setting-sources project`) was tried and dropped: 182k, no gain, loses the user's permission mode.
- Spawn with `task` vs `spawn` -> `peers` -> `assign`: 13 s vs 14 s wall; saves host tool calls (1 vs 3+), not seconds.
- Why workers can win: a worker's prompt prefix is cached across sessions and its per-task context stays small; every Agent pays a fresh ~35-50k cache-create. Why they can lose: a fresh window boots (about 5 s), a worker's context grows (cache-reads climb 79k -> 159k over 4 tasks, so `/compact` or replace it past ~100k), and workers are heavier to start than an Agent, so very wide fan-out (dozens of tiny tasks) still favours Agents.
- Caveats: one run per row; cache warmth favours whoever runs second; the Agent copy in the promo test had read a log line giving it a hint the worker lacked; Agent usage comes from its transcript, which has no cost field.

**When session-link wins over an Agent subagent**
- Work that runs long or in parallel and should not fill your context: a worker's context is separate and its report is <=120 words; a subagent's full result lands in yours.
- Work that needs a different (cheaper) model per task, or a window the user can watch and steer.
- Many tasks for one warm worker: it keeps its files in context, so each later task skips the Agent's per-task startup cost (measured 2.9x cheaper over 4 tasks). Batch related small tasks onto one worker instead of one Agent each.

**When to use the Agent tool instead:** very wide fan-out of tiny independent tasks, a result you need inside the same turn, and a single tiny read when no worker is idle (booting a window costs about 5 s). Do not spawn a window for a task you could finish in two tool calls.

**Fastest path (use this order)**
1. An idle worker exists (`peers`): `assign` to it. No boot, warm context. This is the cheapest and fastest.
2. No idle worker: `spawn` with `task` (the worker starts on it at once, silent, reports with `report`) and `model`. Workers start lean (no MCP servers, no skill listings); pass `lean: false` only when the task needs MCP tools or skills. No join, rename or assign step. Set `difficulty` (or `model`) in the same call.
3. The person's worker limit for this task is reached: do the next piece yourself or queue it. The limit is theirs to set per task (see below); never invent one.

**Spawn only in trusted folders.** A worker window in a folder Claude Code does not trust yet stops at "Do you trust this folder?" and never starts (a real run: three probe workers in `/tmp` hung on it and the user had to answer each). The user's home folder is trusted and covers everything under it; `/tmp` and `/private/tmp` are NOT. Leave `dir` unset (it defaults to the host's own folder) or use a subfolder of the project; for scratch work make a folder under the project or home, never a fresh `/tmp` one. The mod now checks `~/.claude.json` first and refuses with the reason instead of opening a window that would hang. Never edit the trust settings yourself: that decision is the user's.

**Workers per task are the user's call.** There is no built-in cap. When the user says how many workers a task may use ("use 3 workers", "just one"), pass it as `limit` on every `spawn` for that task (`/spawn --limit N`); with no instruction, size the fan-out to the independent pieces and say how many you opened. The plugin option `maxWorkers` is an optional hard ceiling the user can set; unset means none.

**Pick the model by difficulty (Anthropic's guidance: use the smallest model that meets the quality bar, judge cost per completed task, not per request).** Pass `difficulty` on `spawn` (`/spawn --difficulty`); an explicit `model` wins. Current prices per MTok in/out from the Claude API reference: Haiku 5.5 $0.10/$0.50, Sonnet 5.5 $2/$10, Opus 5.5 $4/$20.

| difficulty | model | use for |
|---|---|---|
| easy | `haiku` | simple, high-volume or read-only work: audits, greps, doc/consistency checks, formatting, running tests, extraction, summaries |
| medium | `sonnet` | everyday coding and agent work with a clear spec: multi-file edits against a contract, tests, refactors with a done-when command |
| hard | `opus` | the hardest reasoning: ambiguous design, root-causing an unknown bug, subtle correctness (concurrency, security), long-horizon work, final review of high-stakes changes |

Rules of thumb: start one tier down when a "done when" command can check the result (the host verifies anyway), escalate one tier and retry when the check fails twice, never use `hard` for read-only lookups, and keep the strongest model for the host (planning, verifying, integrating). Name `fable` only when the user asks for Anthropic's most capable model. Workers start with a 100k auto-compact window so they stay small; for UI or big-file workers pass a larger window (see thrash section).

**Manage the flow for quality**
- Contract first, one owner per file, "done when" = an exact command. Then run workers in parallel on disjoint files; the host does only work no worker owns.
- Never ship on a report: re-run the command yourself (reports are claims; see the verification checklist). A cheap model is fine because the host verifies.
- Mutation-check a new test (break the code, see it fail) before trusting it.
- Reuse over respawn: finish a worker's task, then `assign` the next one to it; `/compact` or `/clear` only when it reports NEEDS COMPACT.
- A worker's task can also arrive as its first prompt (that is what `spawn task` does): it registers the same way, stays silent and ends with `.`.

**Test runner for the session-link mod:** `claude plugin test <mod folder>` runs every `*.test.ts(x)` under the folder (verified: 40 pass). Re-run it yourself after any worker edits the mod.

**Lesson (real run):** a worker said "no test runner exists" and shipped an untested failing test; I re-ran `claude plugin test` and caught it. Always put the exact test command in "Done when" and demand the last 4 lines of its real output in the report. Round 1 (read-only audit + find the test command) before round 2 (edits) paid off. Stale tasks (>15 min open) show as stale on /board and stop counting against a worker; `clear`/`compact` are refused on a worker holding an unfinished task.

**If there is no test runner,** say so plainly: a parse/lint/typecheck of the changed files is the floor, and a live try of the feature (a real message between two sessions) is the proof; never call code "tested" on a parse check alone.

## Host playbook additions

**Task template (copy, fill every field; a worker cannot ask follow-ups cheaply):**
```
[TASK <id>] <one-line goal>  (size S/M/L)
Own (may edit): <paths>
Read first: CONTRACT.md section <x>
Do not touch: <paths>
Done when: `<exact command>` exits 0 and prints <expected>
Report: plain text <=120 words: files changed, command output summary, what NOT verified, ctx ~NNk.
Work silently: no chat text, only tool calls, then one `report` call.
```

**Sizing and board.** Keep a board table (worker | task | size | status | ctx). S=1, M=3, L=6 points. Assign to the lowest-point idle worker; never queue on a busy worker while one is idle. Split an L by file ownership before assigning.

**Verification checklist (host runs it, never the worker's word):**
1. Re-run the done-when command yourself; paste the real tail of output.
2. Run the end-to-end path (app/page/CLI) once, with real data, not mocks.
3. Diff-check ownership: no file changed outside the worker's list.
4. State in the final message: verified for real / not verified.

**Failure handling.**
- No report after a long time: call `peers`, then `link_inbox`/board; ping once with a one-line status request; if still silent, reassign to an idle worker after telling the user.
- Report says blocked or asks a question: answer in one short message, do not restate the task.
- Wrong result: reproduce first, then send the owner a task containing the repro command and the expected vs actual values.
- Two workers need the same file: split the file or serialize; never allow concurrent edits.

**Name hygiene.** `peers` (session-link) and `link_peers` can list different IDs for the same windows. Use the tool you assign with, copy names exactly, and re-run `peers` after any restart or rename. Tell the user which names you are using.

**Rename workers (host only; verified working).**
- Workers CANNOT rename themselves: their `rename` tool answers "not the host". Never put a rename step in a worker task.
- The host calls `rename(worker=<current name>, name=<new name>)`. It does not rename instantly: it replies "Asked <x> to rename itself", the worker applies it on its next turn. Call `peers` to confirm before using the new name.
- **Names change by themselves.** A worker's name is not stable: restarting a window gives a new random `pauldenchat-xxxx`, and after an assign a worker may auto-rename to `task-<id>-<verb>` (seen: `task-t3-create`). So ALWAYS call `peers` right before `assign`/`rename`, never reuse a name from earlier in the chat.
- Best moment to rename: when a worker is idle, right after it joins or after its report. Renaming mid-task can lose the name again when it auto-renames.
- Names: lowercase, no spaces, unique. Use numbers for identity: `worker-1`, `worker-2`, ... in join order (add a role if wanted: `ui-1`). The number belongs to the window slot, so after a restart give the new window the same number and tell the user.
- Show `#` in the board and the split table so the user can say "give it to 2". Accept "worker 2", "w2", "2". New windows default to `worker-<next number>`.
- After renaming, tell the user old -> new in one line and update the board.

**Spawn and auto-assign.** `spawn` (host only) opens a new Terminal window as a worker, optionally with a first prompt; use it when the user wants more workers, then rename it. **No built-in worker cap:** the host passes `limit` (the number the user asked for this task; counts running sessions in the spawn folder plus windows opened in the last 15 s that have not joined yet) and the mod refuses a spawn beyond it with "worker limit reached"; parallel spawns are serialized so a limit holds even when calls are fired together; the `maxWorkers` plugin option is an optional hard ceiling. Spawn only when the work splits cleanly; if a worker is idle, assign to it instead. If `spawn` says the session is not the host, the host record is stale or belongs to another window: ask the user to type `/host` in this window (the model cannot run it). `assign worker="auto"` picks the least-loaded worker; use it when sizes are equal, name the worker when ownership matters.

**Run slash commands in workers.** Host tool `command` (or `/run <worker|all> /compact`) makes a worker run a slash command. Allowed only: `compact`, `clear`, `cost` (commands that open no dialog) and only from the registered host. `clear`/`compact` are refused while the worker holds an unfinished task. **/model, /theme, /status, /usage, /effort are NOT allowed**: they open an interactive picker in the worker's window, the worker stays stuck on it and the setting is not applied (seen: `/model haiku` -> worker kept Sonnet). To give a worker another model, the user does `/model` in its window or starts it with `claude --model <name>`. Use `command` to `/compact` a worker that reports NEEDS COMPACT, or `/clear` before re-briefing. Confirm any command by effect (e.g. ask the worker for its ctx after `/compact`), not by the host's "asked" reply, which only proves delivery.

**Cross-tool names.** `peers`/`assign`/`rename` (session-link) and `link_peers`/`link_assign` (link) can list different IDs. Pick ONE tool family for the whole run (session-link) and say so.

**Report handling.** A worker report arrives as a message `[RESULT <id> from="<name>"]`. Treat it as a claim: verify (checklist above), then update the board. Reports contain `ctx ~NNk`; copy it into the board.

**Test log (what a real run showed).** Small S tasks work and stay silent. A task containing a rename step fails. Restart changes names. Auto-rename happens after assign. Fixed by the rules above.

**Shared contract rules.** Constants live in one file only; workers import, never copy. Contract changes are made by the host only, then every affected worker is told in one line which section changed.

**Wrap-up.** When all tasks are verified: one summary table (worker, task, size, verified?), list of unverified items, and open the result for the user if it is a website or app.

## If a worker's autocompact thrashes
Message: "Autocompact is thrashing: the context refilled to the limit within 3 turns of the previous compact, 3 times in a row." Cause: the window is too small for the work (big files re-read after every compact, screenshots).
- Fix the window, not the worker: for UI / large-file workers launch with a bigger window, e.g. `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=300000 claude` (allowed range 100,000-1,000,000). 100,000 is only for workers that touch small files.
- Then `/clear` the worker and re-brief it with ONE self-contained task (files it owns, contract section, done-when check), not the whole history.
- Workers: never read a big file whole. Use grep to find the part, then Read with offset/limit (~150 lines). Do not take screenshots unless the task is visual, and use the smallest viewport that proves the point. Do not re-read files after compacting unless the next step needs them.
- Host: keep files small enough to read in parts. A file over ~600 lines (about 15k tokens) is a refactor candidate: split it into modules per feature so a worker can load only its part.

## Setup the user may want (outside what a skill can do)

- **Compact at 100k tokens.** 100,000 is the smallest value Claude Code accepts for the auto-compact window (range 100,000 to 1,000,000), so it can be set for real. Start each worker with `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=100000 claude`; the variable beats any setting in a settings file and only affects that process. Do NOT use `/autocompact` or put `autoCompactWindow` in your user settings: that is saved per model and would change every session including the host. The window is the size the auto-compact logic works against, so compaction starts a little before 100k, not exactly at it (exact trigger point not verified here). Automatic compaction cannot be tied to "after every turn"; it runs when the threshold is reached.
- Optionally run `/compact` by hand in a worker between big tasks.
- `session-link` option "Auto-run tasks from the host" must be on in the worker windows for tasks to start by themselves.


## Antigravity CLI (`agy`) workers
A session can also hand work to an Antigravity CLI session (`agy`, tested on 1.4.4) through the `link-bridge` MCP server, which both Claude Code and `agy` have registered as `link`. This is separate from the session-link `spawn`/`assign` tools: use the `mcp__link__link_*` tools for agy workers (load them with ToolSearch `select:mcp__link__link_peers,mcp__link__link_host,mcp__link__link_assign,mcp__link__link_inbox,mcp__link__link_board`) and pick ONE family per run.
1. `link_host on: true`, then start a worker: `~/link-bridge/agy-worker.sh -d <trusted folder> -m <model>` (headless) or add `-w` for an interactive window. Run it with Bash; it returns at once.
2. `link_peers`: the worker appears as `agy-<folder>-<id> [agy]`. Address it by that exact name (other `[claude]` / `[codex]` peers on the list are the user's own windows: never assign to them unless asked).
3. `link_assign worker=<exact name> task=<self-contained task>`, then `link_inbox wait_seconds=100` for the `RESULT`. Verify it like any report; agy workers are claims too.
- Models (`agy models`): easy -> `gemini-3.8-flash-low`; medium -> `gemini-3.8-flash-high` or `claude-sonnet-4-6`; hard -> `claude-opus-4-6-thinking`.
- Headless agy cannot ask for permission: a task needing a shell or file access is auto-denied unless a narrow rule exists in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`. Do not use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` and do not add wildcard rules; for such tasks use an interactive window (`-w`) so the user can approve, or tell the user which `command(<prefix>)` rule to add.
- Security question, like Claude's: an interactive agy window in an untrusted folder stops at "Do you trust the contents of this project?" and never starts; headless runs don't ask. `agy-worker.sh -w` pre-checks `trustedWorkspaces` in that settings file and refuses with the reason. Use a trusted folder (`/tmp` is) or ask the user to open agy there once and answer; never edit the trust list yourself.
- The worker stops after two empty `link_inbox` waits (about 200 s) or when its first task is done and nothing follows; start another when you have more work.
- **Image like an agent:** to have agy make an image and then be gone, run `~/link-bridge/agy-image.sh [-o out.jpg] "description"` with Bash. It starts a headless agy, uses its `generate_image` tool once, copies the file, prints the path and exits (no window, no link tools, no permission rule needed). Look at the image yourself before saying it is good. If it fails with `429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` the account's image quota is used up: say so and stop, do not retry in a loop.
- Verified end to end on this machine: Claude host -> `agy` (gemini-3.8-flash-low) -> `RESULT t6fb4 ... 391 agy`, and two sequential tasks to one worker.

## Codex as an agent
For a one-shot task, run `~/link-bridge/codex-agent.sh [-d dir] [-s read-only|workspace-write] [-t secs] "task"` with Bash: it runs `codex exec`, prints the final message and exits, like a subagent (verified: 17 x 23 -> `391` in 12 s).
- Default is the read-only sandbox (a write attempt is refused, verified); pass `-s workspace-write` only when the task must edit files in `-d`. Never use Codex's bypass or full-access options; the helper does not offer them.
- Treat the result as a claim and verify it. Name the folder with `-d`; set `-t` for long tasks.
- For a long-lived Codex worker, use the `link` MCP tools (`link_assign` / `link_inbox`) with a Codex session that has the bridge; the Codex peer on the list may be the user's own window, so assign to it only when asked.

## Known gap: /clear on a worker
Seen on a real run: after the host ran `command /clear` on a worker, the worker kept running but disappeared from `peers` until it finished its next turn (the heartbeat re-registers it), so `assign` said "no session matches". Root cause not found. Workaround: prefer `assign` to a warm worker without clearing; if you did clear, wake it with one `SendMessage` ping, then `peers`, then `assign`; or kill it and `spawn` a fresh one with the task.
